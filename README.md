**Enhancing Visual Place Recognition through Advanced Pooling Strategies and Optimization Techniques**

---
## **Abstract**

Visual Place Recognition (VPR) involves determining the geographic location of a query image by comparing it with a
database of geotagged images. In this paper, we present advancements in visual geolocalization using deep learning
techniques. Building upon the foundational work of the gsvcities project, which leverages Google Street View imagery for
urban geolocalization, we introduce a new dataset, the San Francisco XS Validation Set. Then, we conducted extensive
implementations, hyperparameter tuning, and experiments with various aggregators and optimizers to enhance the modelâ€™s
performance. Our approach was rigorously evaluated using benchmark datasets such as Tokyo XS and the San Francisco Test
Set, enabling a comprehensive comparative analysis. Additionally, we visually examined the model predictions to further
validate their effectiveness. We also investigate the effects of employing MLP-mixer style aggregation. Our results
demonstrate the potential for significant improvements in accuracy through these modifications
